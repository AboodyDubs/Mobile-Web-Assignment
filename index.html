	<h3 id="intro" style="color:black">1- Introduction: </h3>
	<p style="color:black">Mobile application development is a field of programming that involved the creation of applications for mobile devices. Like desktop 
	applications, the development of mobile phone application involves html layout along with a series of functions ran by a client-side processor such as the Javascript to allow the application interact with the user.<br><br>

	<img id="imagetitle" src = "mobilevscomp.png">
	<h3 id="advantage" style="color:black">2- Advantages:</h3><br>
	<p style="color:black">-	Applications’ accessibility is more frequent considering it can be accessed even outside of houses.<br>
	-	Easier and simpler navigation for the common user due to the application scaling to the phone’s screen.<br>
	-	Improves social networking through mobile communications.<br><br></p>

	<img id="imagetitle" src = "DESKTOP-vs-MOBILE.jpg">
	<h3 id= "disadvantage" style="color:black">3- Disadvantages:</h3><br>
	<p style="color:black">-	Sometimes features of an app become compromised due to the small phone screen so that the application can be presented clearly to the common user. (Cannot contain all application features due to limited screen size)<br>
	-	Slower network (packet transfer not as efficient as computers’)<br>
	-	Some phones can become incompatible with developed applications.<br>
	-	Sensitive battery (phone batteries can be consumed faster based on the application’s size)<br>
	-	Less secure because network packets are always transferred publicly<br><br></p>

	<h3 id= "uses" style="color:black">4- Uses: </h3><br>
	<p style="color:black"> -	Business trades: e-commerce helps companies make purchases and sales electronically through phone usage.<br>
	-	Creates time-killing applications (music/game applications that the user can use while waiting for a bus for example.)<br>
	-	Creates GPS applications (applications that keep track of the users’ location during travel). <br></p>
